# Bee & Flower Simulation — Godot Project
## 🐝 Overview

This Godot 4 project simulates the natural process of pollination through autonomous interactions between bees, flowers, and a hive.
Each bee is controlled by a simple physics-based script, but together they exhibit emergent collective behavior — flying between flowers, avoiding collisions, collecting pollen, and returning to the hive.

The project demonstrates how local rules and minimal AI can create lifelike and dynamic environmental behavior.
